1. MARKETPLACE


   1. Before you list your item(s), you need to find out if your item is allowed on Homemade1616 and if the type of item is subject to certain restrictions to avoid potential issues with your listing. Only items that are legally allowed by seller’s local (State, Municipality, City and Health Department or any other local law) may be listed on Homemade1616.com.  We encourage you to closely review the laws applicable to you (e.g., review the list of approved cottage food for your state, regulations on interstate sales and delivery and/or shipping, etc.). As a Homemade1616 seller, you are ultimately responsible for making sure that selling an item is legal in the eyes of the laws.  
   2. Policies about posting items are often based on county and state laws. These laws may also vary depending on product type, distribution methods, the end buyer, and the amount sold. This includes any state laws regarding certification, grading, sorting, labeling, or marketing. When selling across borders, be aware of trading and import restrictions. Certain items may be legal in your country or state, but may be illegal to sell outside border lines. Photos, comments, and product labels are often  subject to regional laws. You are responsible for knowing and adhering to all country and state laws.
