Thank you for creating an online storefront at Homemade1616.com.  We appreciate that you chose us to feature and sell your products!
 
Your storefront will be activated immediately, so please make sure your items are described clearly and that you’ve selected beautiful pictures that fully represent your products. Also, be sure to complete your profile… that’s how buyers really get to know who you are and trust what you make.
 
Occasionally, we will send messages to this email address, for example, when you make a sale or when we have news to share with you. Please make sure to update your profile if your contact information changes (under the “My Account” link on the main menu bar). Finally, if you just clicked the box stating that you read our “Terms of Use” without actually reading them, please go back and take a look at what we expect of our community members.
 
Thanks again for joining Homemade1616. We look forward to helping you grow your food business!
